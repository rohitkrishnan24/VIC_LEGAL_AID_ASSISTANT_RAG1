1. Legislative Framework and Jurisdiction

Criminal law in Australia operates through a dual framework comprising Commonwealth and State jurisdictions. The Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) is the principal statute regulating indictable and summary offences within Victoria, while the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) governs federal crimes such as terrorism, cybercrime, and offences against the Commonwealth. The Criminal Procedure Act 2009 (Vic) prescribes procedural norms for charging, trial, and appeals, whereas the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) codifies sentencing objectives and proportionality principles. Together, these instruments ensure a coherent legal architecture grounded in due process and public accountability.

2. Classification and Elements of Offences

Offences are classified as summary or indictable, depending on their gravity and procedural handling. Summary offences—such as minor assaults or property damage—are tried in the Magistrates’ Court without a jury. Indictable offences—such as homicide under s.3A–s.9 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic)—require trial by jury in the County or Supreme Court. Each offence must satisfy actus reus (the physical act) and mens rea (the mental intent), principles inherited from the English common law tradition. The burden of proof rests on the prosecution, which must establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

3. Investigative and Procedural Processes

Investigative powers are exercised by Victoria Police under statutory authority. Arrest and detention are regulated by Part III of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) and by common-law safeguards against arbitrary detention. The accused’s rights include access to counsel, silence during questioning, and protection from self-incrimination, consistent with the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic), s.25.
Proceedings begin with a filing hearing in the Magistrates’ Court, followed by a committal mention and, where appropriate, trial. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) assumes carriage of indictable prosecutions on behalf of the Crown.

4. Sentencing and Penological Principles

The Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) provides a structured framework for judicial discretion. Section 5(2) articulates guiding purposes—punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, and community protection. Sentences include imprisonment, community correction orders, fines, and adjourned undertakings. Courts may consider aggravating and mitigating factors such as remorse, prior record, and victim impact.
Appellate review of sentencing occurs through the Court of Appeal, which ensures parity and prevents manifest excess. In cases of federal offences, the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) governs sentence administration and parole eligibility.

5. Victims’ Rights and Restorative Justice

Victims of crime are recognised as stakeholders in the justice process under the Victims’ Charter Act 2006 (Vic). They have rights to information, respectful treatment, and participation through victim impact statements. The Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal (VOCAT) provides financial assistance for injuries, counselling, or property loss arising from criminal acts. Increasingly, Victoria integrates restorative justice approaches—such as conferencing and diversion programs—to reduce recidivism and improve community reintegration.

6. Federal Dimensions and Inter-jurisdictional Coordination

Where offences involve interstate or international elements—such as cyber fraud, terrorism, or human trafficking—the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) applies. Sections 471–474 (cyber offences) and Part 5.3 (terrorism) illustrate federal legislative competence. Federal and state agencies cooperate through joint task forces, with oversight by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP). Extradition between jurisdictions follows the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 (Cth).

7. Academic and Policy Perspectives

Scholars emphasise that Victorian criminal law balances retributive and rehabilitative philosophies. Sentencing data indicate a gradual shift toward evidence-based interventions, such as community orders, to address criminogenic needs. Ongoing debates concern judicial discretion, Indigenous incarceration, and proportionality in sentencing. Academic literature situates Victoria’s approach as hybrid—anchored in common-law precedent yet responsive to socio-legal reform.
